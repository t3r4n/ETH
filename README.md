# AI for Ethereum Protocols

This project explores how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be applied to Ethereum’s core infrastructure. We focus on client engineering, P2P optimization, and MEV mitigation strategies, aiming to integrate AI as a native component of the protocol layer.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- MEV detection and adaptive defense mechanisms  
- Peer scoring and network topology optimization  
- Predictive analytics for client performance  
- Reinforcement learning in consensus participation

## 📘 Goal

To research and prototype AI-driven tools that improve the security, efficiency, and decentralization of Ethereum.

## 🧪 Project Status: In Early Development
This project is currently in its early stages of development.
Core components such as the custom Gym environment and the DQN training pipeline are in place, but further refinements, testing, and integrations with Ethereum-specific mechanisms (e.g., MEV simulation, client modeling) are still in progress.

Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome!
