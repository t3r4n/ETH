# AI for Ethereum Protocols

This project explores how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be applied to Ethereum’s core infrastructure. We focus on client engineering, P2P optimization, and MEV mitigation strategies, aiming to integrate AI as a native component of the protocol layer.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- MEV detection and adaptive defense mechanisms  
- Peer scoring and network topology optimization  
- Predictive analytics for client performance  
- Reinforcement learning in consensus participation

## 📘 Goal

To research and prototype AI-driven tools that improve the security, efficiency, and decentralization of Ethereum.
